				Git Notes

Overview:

This will be a simple list of important git commands I learned reading pro-git.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

git stage/commit commands:
-------------------------
- git commits are snapshots of your project, that you can revert to, and even compare snapshots

git commit - Opens commit message

git commit -v - Puts the diff of our changes into the editor when adding commit message

git commit -a - Stages all modified files before committing, but it doesn't add untracked files.

git commit -m "commit messge"- Add the commit message as an argument

git commit -am "message"
	- add all staged files, and put message inline

git commit --amend
	- allows you to update the previous commit
	- adds all files in the staging area, and lets you add a new commit message
	- only works on local commits that haven't been pushed anywhere
	- entirely replaces the last local commit

git restore --staged <file>
	- unstages a staged file

git restore <file>
	- discard changes to a modified (unstaged) file
	- permanently lose all changes

git status - Shows status of files in current repo:
	- not tracked
	- unmodified
	- modified
	- staged

git status -s  - Shows status in short format
	- Left column is Staged area, Right column is working tree

git add <file> - Stage the new/modified file so it is included in next commit

git rm <file> - Stage a deleted file, so it is removed from the next commit

git rm -f <file> - If the file was modified or staged, the -f is required to remove it

git rm --cached <file> - Remove file from your staging area, but doesn't delete the file from the working tree.

- The '\' is required in front of the wildcare '*' because git does its own filename expansion
git rm log/\*.log
git rm  \*~

git mv <file-1> <file-2>

	- Above is equivalent of: mv <file-1> <file-1> ; git rm <file-1> ; git add <file-2>
	- There is literally no other benefit to 'git mv' it is just shorthand for the 3 commands above.
----------------------------------------------------------------
	
git diff commands:
-----------------

git diff - shows changed between working directory and staging area.
	- i.e. shows diff for unstaged changes. Changed working directory, and compares to staging area

	- If you staged all your changes, this will show nothing

git diff --staged - Shows chages between what you staged to what was in last commit (current remote repo)
	--cached - Same flag as --staged

-----------------------------------------------------------------

git log commands:
----------------

git log - show the commit history

git log -p -2

	-p - show the diff of each commit

	-2 - show only the last two entries

	--stat - gives abbreviated stats for each commit

	--pretty=oneline , --pretty=short/full/fuller

git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"

	- Prints git log 'commits' in a specific format.
	- Look up all the "git log --pretty=format" specifiers
	- there are 'abbreviated commit hash', 'Author name', 'Author date', 'Subject'

git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph

	--graph shows your branch and merge history

git log --since=2.weeks / 2.days / 2025-1-15 / --after is same
	--until / --before

git log --author=Linus	- only shows commits where author name contains 'Linus'

	--grep="pattern" - Search the entire commit for a value

	- Can include multiple --author and --grep.

	--all-match - requires all of the --author and --grep match

git log -S "print_array" - Show commits where diff changes the amount of a "string"
	- Useful for finding new uses of function calls.

git log -- path/to/file
	- Always the last option
	- Only show commits that made changes to "path/to/file"

	--no-merges - hides merge commits. IMPORTANT


NOTE - Author originally wrote the code, and Committer is the core team member who applied the patch

------------------------------------------------------------------

git remote commands:
-------------------

git remote - shows remote repositories configured

	-v - shows URL and other data about remote repos
	
git remote <repo>

git remote show <remote>

git remote add <shortname> <url>
	- add a remote repo as <shortname>, with the remote repo <url>

git remote rename <current-repo-name> <new-repo-name>

git remote remove <repo-name>

git fetch - pulls data from the remote repository
	- Doesn't automatically merge data, have to merge manually

git fetch <repo>

git pull - pulls data from the remote repository
	- Does automatically merge data

git pull <repo>

git push <repo> <branch> - Pushes commits to local <branch> to remote <repo>
	- just 'git push' will push checked out branch to configured remote repo

-----------------------------------------------------------------

git tag commands:
-----------------

git tag - list all tag

git tag -l "v1.8.5*" - list tags that match a specific pattern

	-l - lists tags, only required if using a pattern

git tag -a <tag-name> -m <tag-message>
	git tag -a v4.0.0 -m "This is version 4.0.0?
	-a - Creates an Annotated Tag, which is stored as a full object.

git tag <tag-name>
	Creates a light-weight tag, only a pointer to a commit checksum, no other data like annotated tags

git push origin <tag>
git push <remote> <tag>
	Tags are not pushed automatically, but need pushed explicitly.

git push origin --tags
	Push all tags to the remote

git tag -d <tag>
	Delete a tag locally

git push <remote> :refs/tags/<tagname>
git push origin :refs/tags/v4.0.0
	Delete tags on a remote repo

git push origin --delete <tag>
	The normal way to delete a tag on the remote server

git checkout <tag>
	Checkouts the files related to a Tag
-----------------------------------------------------------------

misc git commands:
-----------------

git show <object>
	<object> can be - remote, branch, tag, etc..
