x = integer that bits will be got from.
p = binary position in x
n = number of bits to retrieve from x

getbits(int x, int p, int n)


int bitSection = (x >> (p + 1 - n)
Move to right side of bit word. Bitword is end of bits to be retrieved.
This is p + n. It moves to p (positon), and then to the end of n (num of bits).
It has everything before p in the bits as well.
