1. Add error handling to ch2 exercise 6.

2. verify function names are allowed in exercise 4-5
	Have to verify all alphabet chars greater than 1 are a valid function.
	Seems almost impossible to do in depth.
	Could at least check that the name of the function is valid,
	but it's hard to check just the name if it is missing the '('.
