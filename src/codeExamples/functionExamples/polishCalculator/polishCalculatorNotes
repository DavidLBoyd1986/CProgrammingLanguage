Exercise 4-3:
Negative Numbers:

Negative numbers are the same symbol as subtraction. So I have to deal with that in the getop function.

Got it working using getch and ungetch to check the next char if a '-' pops up.
----------------------

Exercise 4-4:

Got half the added commands to work by using the val[] instead of the buffer and getch like an idiot.

still need to get these to work:

! - clearStack()
	It doesn't clear the stack.
	It does clear the stack.
You just have to clear it, and then do some more than and it only calculates what was added after the clear.

& - duplicatech()
	It doesn't seem to continue the problem after it duplicates the value.
	I'm not sure what should happen when the value is duplicated, is it put on the stack again?
	I think it must be duplicated and put on the stack.
	These exercises can be way too vague.
	I got it to work with just adding the top value again on top the stack.
	That has to be what they mean for you to do.
