Opening Files:

fopen() - open files in different modes

r - read, only reads the file
	Fails if file doesn't exist

w - write, opens the file in write mode, clears all data in file
	Creates file if it doesn't exist

a - append, opens the file in write mode, but does not clear out all the data
	Creates file if it doesn't exist

r+ - read and write.
	Fails if file doesn't exist
	Appends writes after existing data ('r' 'r'espects existing data)

w+ - read and write.
	Creates file if it doesn't exist
	Overwrites the existing data ('w' existing data is 'w'rong)
	Old contents are lost the moment you open the file in w+ mode

a+ - read and write. (Course said it can't read, but they were wrong)
	Creates file if it doesn't exist
	Appends writes after existing data

Character reading:

fgetc() - read characters from a file
fputc() - write characters to a file

Structured Data:

fscanf() - read structured data from a file
fprintf() - write structured data to a file

Strings:

fgets() - to read strings from files
fputs() - write strings to files

Binary Data:

fread() - to read binary data from files
fwrite() - to write binary data into files

File positions operations:

ftell() - returns the current position of the file pointer
fseek() - sets the file pointer to the given position
rewind() - sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file
