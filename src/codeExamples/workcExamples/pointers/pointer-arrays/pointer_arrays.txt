Arrays are just a pointer to the first element in the array. The type of an array variable is literally a pointer to type of data array is storing. 

	For example an "int array[10]" is of type "int*" because the int array is just a pointer to the first array element, which is an int.

Arrays are a continuous sequence of memory, and the later elements can be accessed by iterating through the array

But, you don't have to iterate through the whole array, to get to later indexes. You can add to the pointer address to get to a later index.

	For example, add (sizeof(element) * index to access) to the array pointer, to get the pointer to that array index.
